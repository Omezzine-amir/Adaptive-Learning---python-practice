1) Printing Use print() to show output.
2) Variables Assign with =. Example: x = 3
3) Strings Text is in quotes: "hello". Combine with +.
4) If statements if condition: then indented code runs.
5) Loops for i in range(5): runs 5 times (0 to 4).
6) Functions Define reusable logic: def add(a,b): return a+b
Tip: Python cares about indentation. Use 4 spaces.
